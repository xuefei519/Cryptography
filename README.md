# Cryptography

This project includes two programs with user friendly interface, one for substitution encryption and one for breaking it using two-gram frequency of letters. The encryption program encrypts the plain-text with any non-duplicate key, and the other program automatically breaks the ciphertext produced by the encryption program.

###TO IMPLEMENT:

 1. Run the enciper.jar file.
 2. Enter any key (all use the random generated key) and plain text to encipher.
 3. Run the hacking.jar file.
 4. Copy the ciphertext to the textarea to crack the key.
